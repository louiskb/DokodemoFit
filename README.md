# Dokodemo Fit
AI tool that creates workout routines and meal plans depending on goals and equipment available

## Technology Stack

The app was built using Ruby on Rails, and uses the Ruby-LLM Gem to call to the OpenAI LLM provided by GitHub. The number of tokens is limited, so the tool will not work when under load.
